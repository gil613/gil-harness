# /harness:run

**Auto-loop**: Runs stages sequentially until DONE is reached or the retry limit is exceeded. No manual intervention needed.

Loop order: REQUIREMENTS → ROADMAP → DEVELOPMENT → REVIEW → DONE

### User intent capture

If the user passed any text after `/harness:run` (i.e. `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty), capture it once at the very start of this command as `userIntent`. It is **not** a directive that overrides stage logic — it is a hint forwarded to the worker sub-agent (see LOOP-3) so requirements collection / development can focus on what the user actually asked for this cycle. Trim whitespace; if the result is empty, treat as no intent.

---

## Loop Procedure

**Repeat the following until DONE is reached or a stop condition occurs.**

### Loop discipline (CRITICAL — ZERO TOLERANCE)

You have a **0-character output budget between tool calls**. The ONLY user-visible text allowed in this entire procedure is the literal `messages.*` strings the procedure explicitly mandates printing (e.g. `messages.previous_failure`, `messages.stage_advanced`). After every tool return, the next action MUST be either (a) a tool call, or (b) a mandated `messages.*` print followed immediately by the next tool call. No exceptions.

**Forbidden patterns — DO NOT generate ANY of these, even once:**

- Intro / greeting before first tool call: ❌ `상태를 확인하고 파이프라인을 시작하겠습니다`, ❌ `Let me check the state…`, ❌ `Starting the pipeline`
- Status summaries after a Read: ❌ `현재 상태: DEVELOPMENT 단계, 반복 1/3`, ❌ `I see we're in iteration 1/3`, ❌ `이전 실패를 수정하겠습니다`
- Plan announcements before the next tool call: ❌ `로드맵에서 ...를 찾겠습니다`, ❌ `I will now read…`, ❌ `다음으로 ...를 진행`
- Step labels: ❌ `LOOP-1 실행 중`, ❌ `Step 3: …`, ❌ `Now executing validate.md`
- Tool acknowledgments: ❌ `파일을 읽었습니다`, ❌ `Read complete`, ❌ `Got it`
- Apologies, hedges, transitional connectors

Every one of these phrases costs 30–80 tokens and they accumulate into thousands across a full pipeline run. The user has explicitly objected to this verbosity — treat any such output as a procedural violation.

**Allowed user-visible output:**

- Literal `messages.*` strings the procedure mandates (`messages.cycle_resumed`, `messages.auto_retro`, `messages.previous_failure`, `messages.stage_advanced`, `messages.full_pipeline_done`, `messages.stage_failed_retry`, `messages.stage_regressed_retry`, `messages.retry_limit`, `messages.retry_limit_reached`, `messages.worker_failed`)
- The retro report summary that retro.md itself prints at the end of LOOP-5a (it is part of retro.md's output, not yours to embellish)

**Stop conditions** — only here may you stop without immediately issuing the next tool call: `state.iteration >= state.maxRetries`, worker sub-agent failure, retro completion in 5a-DONE. Anywhere else, stopping or narrating is a bug.

**Self-check before any non-tool output**: ask yourself "is this the literal text of a `messages.*` entry the procedure mandates?" If no, do not emit it — issue the next tool call instead.

---

### LOOP-1. Load state

(Discipline reminder: your **first** action on `/harness:run` is the Read tool call below. Do NOT emit any greeting, plan, or status preamble. The user does not need to be told you are about to read state.)

- Read `.harness/state.json` and `.harness/config.json`
- Read `config.uiLanguage` — all subsequent user-facing output uses messages from the `## Messages` table below, keyed by this value
- If `state.stage === 'DONE'`:
  - **The user just invoked `/harness:run` — that itself is the strongest signal that they want a new cycle. Do NOT bail with "all done" and force the user into a `reset --stage` dance.** Recover automatically:
    - Look at `state.history`. If its last entry has `stage === "RETROSPECTIVE"`, retro already ran in this cycle; the only thing missing is the stage reset. Edit `.harness/state.json`: set `stage` to `"REQUIREMENTS"`, `iteration` to `0`, `failures` to `[]`, `lastValidated` to `null`. Print `messages.cycle_resumed`. Then **WITHOUT generating any further text, immediately re-read `.harness/state.json` as the very next action and continue this LOOP-1 with the refreshed state.**
    - Otherwise (no retrospective entry — the cycle reached DONE without a retro, e.g. an interrupted prior run or a pre-0.3.0 state file): print `messages.auto_retro`, then **execute the retro.md procedure inline within this session** (skip the dirty-tree check — step 1 of retro.md). Retro's step 6 will reset `stage` to `REQUIREMENTS`. After retro completes, **WITHOUT generating any further text, immediately re-read `.harness/state.json` as the very next action and continue this LOOP-1 with the refreshed state.**
- If `state.iteration >= state.maxRetries`, print `messages.retry_limit` and stop the loop

---

### LOOP-2. Acknowledge previous failure (if any)

If the last entry in `state.failures` matches the current stage, print `messages.previous_failure` populated with `<cause>` and `<plan>`. This information is also passed to the worker sub-agent (LOOP-3).

**WITHOUT generating any further text, immediately proceed to LOOP-3 by issuing the Task tool call as the very next action.** If no previous failure exists, also proceed straight to LOOP-3 with no narration.

---

### LOOP-3. Call worker sub-agent

(Discipline reminder: this step issues multiple Read calls — overrides file, prior artifacts (requirements/roadmap/progress) — and then the Task call. Between each Read there must be **zero** narration. Do not announce which file you're about to read; do not summarize what you just read. Read → Read → Read → Task.)

stage → sub-agent mapping:

| stage | sub-agent |
|-------|-----------|
| REQUIREMENTS | requirements-collector |
| ROADMAP | roadmap-designer |
| DEVELOPMENT | developer |
| REVIEW | reviewer |

#### Load overrides

If `.harness/agents-overrides/<subagent_type>.md` exists, read it. Otherwise use an empty string.

#### Task prompt template

Call via the `Task` tool. Omit blocks that do not apply:

```
[STAGE]
<current stage name>

[CONFIG]
<full .harness/config.json>

[OUTPUT LANGUAGE]
{config.uiLanguage}

All free-form text in your artifact bodies, your one-line caller report, and any user-visible
narrative MUST be in this language. Protocol identifiers (section headers like "## Done",
result labels like "VALIDATION_RESULT:", task IDs like "T01", AC IDs like "AC1") MUST stay
verbatim in English. See your agent's "Output Language" section for the exact list.

[PREVIOUS ARTIFACTS]
ROADMAP: requirements.md
DEVELOPMENT: requirements.md, roadmap.md, progress.md (if present)
REVIEW: requirements.md, roadmap.md, progress.md
(inline each file's content inside ``` fences)

[USER INTENT]   ← only when the captured `userIntent` from the top of this command is non-empty
<userIntent verbatim>

This is a free-form hint from the user about what they want this cycle to focus on
(e.g. "add T08", "fix login bug"). Treat it as a focus signal — narrow your Q&A or
implementation toward this. It does NOT override stage rules, completion criteria,
or existing artifacts. If it contradicts the current stage's role, ignore it.

[PREVIOUS FAILURE]   ← only when the last state.failures entry matches the current stage
Cause: <cause>
Fix plan: <plan>

[OVERRIDE]   ← only when agents-overrides file exists
<file contents verbatim>

[INSTRUCTIONS]
Save the artifact to .harness/<artifact name>.md.
Artifact names: requirements / roadmap / progress / review-report
Report in one line when done.
```

#### Worker failure handling

If the sub-agent fails or aborts, do not change state and stop the loop. Print `messages.worker_failed` populated with `<reason>`.

(Distinguish from a validation failure — do not increment the iteration counter)

#### After Task returns (normal completion)

When the Task tool returns successfully, **WITHOUT generating any further text and without summarizing the worker's output, immediately begin LOOP-4** by issuing the first tool call required by the validate.md procedure as the very next action.

---

### LOOP-4. Run validation (inline validate.md procedure)

If the worker finishes normally, **execute the validate.md procedure inline within this session**.

Perform the full validate.md procedure inline and hold the PASS / FAIL result as an internal variable.

**When validate.md completes (state.json has been updated), WITHOUT generating any further text, immediately call `Read .harness/state.json` as the very next action to begin LOOP-5.** Do not summarize validation results — LOOP-5 will print the appropriate message.

---

### LOOP-5. Loop branch

Branch based on the validate result and updated state.

#### 5a. PASS

`state.json` is already updated to the next stage. Re-read the state.

- If new `state.stage === 'DONE'`:
  - Print `messages.full_pipeline_done`
  - **Execute the retro.md procedure inline within this session** (skip the dirty-tree check — step 1 of retro.md)
  - Stop the loop after retro completes
- Otherwise: print `messages.stage_advanced` populated with `<prev>` and `<new>`, then **WITHOUT generating any further text, immediately call `Read .harness/state.json` as the very next action to execute LOOP-1 — do NOT stop, do NOT return control to the user, do NOT wait for input**

#### 5b. FAIL

`state.json`'s `iteration` is already incremented by 1. Re-read `state.json` now — validate may have regressed to an earlier stage.

- If `state.iteration < state.maxRetries`:
  - If `state.stage` differs from the stage that just ran (regression occurred):
    - Print `messages.stage_regressed_retry` populated with `<fromStage>`, `<toStage>`, `<iteration>`, `<maxRetries>`, `<cause>`, `<plan>`
  - Else (same-stage retry):
    - Print `messages.stage_failed_retry` populated with `<stage>`, `<iteration>`, `<maxRetries>`, `<cause>`, `<plan>`
  - **WITHOUT generating any further text, immediately call `Read .harness/state.json` as the very next action to execute LOOP-1 — do NOT stop, do NOT ask the user for action**
- If `state.iteration >= state.maxRetries`:
  - Print `messages.retry_limit_reached` populated with `<stage>`
  - Stop loop
